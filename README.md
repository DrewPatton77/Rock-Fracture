## Abstract
Externally stressed brittle rocks fail once the stress is sufficiently high. This failure is typically preceded by
a pronounced increase in the total energy of acoustic emission (AE) events, the so-called accelerated seismic
release. Yet, other characteristics of approaching the failure point such as the presence or absence of variations
in the AE size distribution and, similarly, whether the failure point can be interpreted as a critical point in a
statistical physics sense differs across experiments. Here, we show that large-scale stress heterogeneities induced
by a notch fundamentally change the characteristics of the failure point in triaxial compression experiments under
a constant displacement rate on Westerly granite samples. Specifically, we observe accelerated seismic release
without a critical point and no change in power-law exponent $\epsilon$ of the AE size distribution. This is in contrast to
intact samples, which exhibit a significant decrease in $\epsilon$ before failure. Our findings imply that the presence or
absence of large-scale heterogeneities play a significant role in our ability to predict compressive failure in rock.

## Description
My research delves into the intricate behavior of rocks when subjected to an increase in significant stress, such as that experienced during geological events like earthquakes.
The process by which rocks fracture under stress is far from straightforward--but instead is quite a complex process: Imagine a piece of rock with tiny cracks within it. 
As external pressure mounts, these cracks form, grow, and coalesce, releasing stored energy in a manner analogous to the distinct crackle noise when stepping on dry leaves.

What I'm undertaking is an investigation into how the presence of a pre-existing notch in the rock's structure influences the way it breaks apart.
To accomplish this, we employed specialized equipment and instrumentation to record the acoustic emissions produced by the rock as it undergoes stress. 
These acoustic signals provide valuable insights into the internal processes at play. In particular, acoustic emissions provide a wealth of knowledge in the number of microcrack events over a period of time, the acoustic energy released, the position in 3-dimensions,
and even discern how these microcracks form â€“ whether through compaction, shearing, or tensile forces.
The rock samples we used are all Westerly granite samples, and are separated between being notched and intact.

My findings reveal that the fracture patterns in rocks can vary substantially depending on their structural properties: Intact samples follow a failure process known as a critical failure, in which
the average energy accelerates. While the notched samples have a stationary average energy, yet still exhibit an accelerated increase in the energy.
This understanding carries significant implications for the prediction and mitigation of geological hazards like earthquakes and landslides, ultimately contributing to enhanced safety measures.
